<p>A player usually carries several clubs during the game (but no more than fourteen, the limit defined by the rules).
 There are three major types of clubs, known as woods, irons, and putters. Woods are played for long shots from the tee 
 or fairway, and occasionally rough, while irons are for precision shots from fairways as well as from the rough. Wedges
  are irons used to play shorter shots. A new type of club called a hybrid combines the straight-hitting characteristics
   of irons with the easy-to-hit characteristics of higher-lofted woods.</p>
   <p> A hybrid is often used for long shots from
    difficult rough. Hybrids are also used by players who have a difficult time getting the ball airborne with long 
    irons. Wedges are played from difficult ground such as sand or the rough and for approach shots to the green. 
    Putters are mostly played on the green, but can also be useful when playing from bunkers or for some approach shots.
     Putters have minimal loft, forcing the ball to stay on the putting surface when struck. The most common clubs to 
     find in a golfer's bag are the driver, 3-wood, numbered irons from 3 to 9 (with hybrids commonly replacing the 3 
     and 4 iron), pitching and sand wedges, and a putter. Players commonly also carry a 5-wood, and/or additional wedges
      such as a gap or lob wedge.</p>

<p>Originally, golf balls were made of a hardwood, such as beech. Beginning between the 14th and 16th centuries, more 
expensive golf balls were made of a leather skin stuffed with down feathers; these were called "featheries". Around the
 mid-1800s, a new material called gutta-percha, made from the latex of the East Asian sapodilla tree, started to be used
  to create more inexpensive golf balls nicknamed "gutties", which had similar flight characteristics as featheries.
   These then progressed to "brambles" in the later 1800s, using a raised dimple pattern and resembling bramble fruit, 
   and then to "meshies" beginning in the early 1900s, where ball manufacturers started experimenting with latex rubber 
   cores and wound mesh skins that created recessed patterns over the ball's surface. </p>
