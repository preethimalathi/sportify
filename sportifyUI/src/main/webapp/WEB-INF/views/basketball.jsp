<p>A basketball is a spherical inflated ball used in basketball games. Basketballs typically range in size from very
 small promotional items only a few inches in diameter to extra large balls nearly a foot in diameter used in training 
 exercises. For example, a basketball in high school would be about 27 inches in circumference, while an NBA ball would 
 be about 29 inches. The actual standard size of a basketball in the NBA is 29.5 inches in circumference.

Aside from the court and the baskets, the basketball is the only piece of equipment necessary to play the game of
 basketball. During the game, the ball must be bounced continuously (dribbling), thrown through the air to other 
 players (passing) and towards the basket (shooting). Therefore, the ball must be very durable and easy to hold on to.
  The basketball is also used to perform tricks (sometimes called freestyling), the most common of which are spinning 
  the ball on the tip of one's index finger, dribbling in complex patterns, rolling the ball over one's shoulder, or 
  performing aerobatic maneuvers with the ball while executing a slam dunk, most notably in the context of a slam dunk
   contest.</p>
