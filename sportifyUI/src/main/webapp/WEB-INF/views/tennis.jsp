   <p>Tennis Racket ( or Racket) is tennis implement consisting of a handled frame with open hoop across which a network of cord is streched tightly.
    In tennis sport  racket is used for striking a ball. Because playing with rackets tennis and similar sports 
    are known as racket sports. Traditionally the frame for rackets was made of laminated wood and strings of animal
     intestine (gut) was most commonly used</p>
     <p> The traditional tennis racket size was limited by the strength and weight of the wooden frame. 
     Because that racket manufacturers started adding non-wood laminates to wood rackets to improve stiffness.
      First were made of steel, then of aluminium, and then of carbon fiber composite materials. 
      In time strings (gut) has been replaced by syntethic materials (polyamide, nylon)and other polymers. 
      Professional players restrung rackets after every match and amateurs  when is necessary (or never).</p>

          <p>Tennis balls are designed for the tennis game and they have 6,70 cm in diameter and ordinarily color of 
          tennis equipment balls in official events is light green, in recreational tennis can be in any color. 
          In the history of tennis equipment ,first tennis balls were made of leather stuffed with wool or hair. 
          Today's balls are covered in a fibrous soft felt which changes their aerodynamic properties. 
          Less pressure balls generally have a stiffer feel than more pressurized balls, and except for the
           Tretorn brand tennis balls equipment, do not bouncing as high brand new pressurized tennis balls. 
           These balls don't lose bounce over time. Due to fuzz loss they get bouncier as they get lighter.With 
           more they balder get, the more they flight ,bounce and spin response changes from what player would 
           require of tennis equipment balls. World production of new tennis equipment balls is about 300,000,000 
           balls per year.</p>
