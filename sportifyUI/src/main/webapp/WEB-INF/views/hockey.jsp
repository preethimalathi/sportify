<p>Field hockey sticks have an end which varies in shape, often depending on the players position. In general there are
 four main variations on head:
The 'shorti' is mainly used by players wishing extreme control over the ball, and increase their maneuverability. This 
specific head is most associated with the mid-field position. (or center for Ice Hockey)

The 'Midi' is used by players who will be hitting the ball often and need to be strong on their 'reverse side'. This 
specific head is most associated with the striker, or 'up-front' position.

The 'Maxi' is similar to the 'Midi' as it has an increased surface area which is useful for hitting. However its 
strength allows it to be used much more effectively for stopping the ball. This head is used by 'defenders' and 'attackers'.</p>
